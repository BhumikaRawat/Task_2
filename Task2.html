                “Adventure Time” grew from its sword-and-sorcery origins to become something surreal and difficult to define. It is an adventure series where one of the hero’s biggest challenges was getting over his unrequited crush; a fantasy show whose mystical elements included candy; and a children’s cartoon that regularly featured cannibalism.
             <br><br>
             Beyond the show itself, “Adventure Time” served as an animation talent incubator: Many of the series’s writers and artists went on to develop their own projects, mirroring the dispersion of writers and producers on prestige shows like “The Sopranos” and “Breaking Bad.” In part, this was because “Adventure Time” accommodated and cultivated the different artistic sensibilities of each person who worked on the show.
